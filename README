Basic Idea is to solve the 15 puzzle by implementing an iterative deepening depth first search
second version used a dynamic programming technique called memoization to ignore repeated states

Uses Java 8

Step 1. rename Main.java.txt to Main.java

Step 2. should be able to compile and run with
 ```
 javac IDDFS.java
 java IDDFS
 ```

Step 3.

optionally run with a user input state string, ex:

(Warning: Since manhattan distance wasn't able to be implemented fully, I noticed adding too much entropy into the input string
makes the program run MUCH longer consider just one or two swaps to save yourself some time)

 ```java IDDFS "1 7 2 4 5 0 3 8 9 6 11 12 13 10 14 15"```
