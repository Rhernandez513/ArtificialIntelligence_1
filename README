Basic Idea is to solve the 15 puzzle by implementing the Iterative Deepening A* search algorithm
We use two different heuristics (1. Misplaced Squares; 2. Manhattan distance of state from goal), to show how better designed heuristics positively impact speedup

Uses Java 8

Should be able to compile and run with
 ```
 javac IDAStar.java
 java IDAStar
 ```

Step 3.

optionally run with a user input state string, ex:

 ```java IDAStar "1 2 3 4 5 10 6 0 9 7 11 8 13 14 15 12"```

Step 4.

The console will prompt you for input (y/n).
'y' will trigger both Misplaced Tiles heuristic and Manhattan Distance heuristic
Any input other than 'y' will trigger only Manhattan Distance heuristic.
Compatible with both command line user input state string as well as default runtime string (demonstrated above) that should be solved in 2 iterations
