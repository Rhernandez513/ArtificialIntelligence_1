Idea is to implement a supervised decision learning algorithm as described in Figure 18.5 in AIMA 3rd ed.
Written using Java 8

TO BUILD:
```javac Main.java```
TO RUN:
```java Main```
or
```java Main /path/to/trainingData.csv```

the program expects the training data format to be exactly as provided in the example

if running without a provided input training data, the program expects the following project structure

/resources/restaurant.csv
/src/com/company/Main.java


!!NOTE!!: The way the program PRINTS the tree is not the prettiest, please not the many closing brackets on line 37 of output using restaurant.csv
            this is because the program PRINTS the tree DEPTH FIRST, but only formats the output by type of Node (Root, Node, Leaf).
            I wish I was be able to do a "pretty print"
