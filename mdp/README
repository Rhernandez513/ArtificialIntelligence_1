TO BUILD:
	make
TO RUN:
	./cmake-build-debug/mdp "resources/mdp_input.txt"

INFO:
Input format should be the same as mdp_input.txt example provided (whitespace, colons, etc)

To view Value Iteration ONLY place a '1' before input
	example:  ./mdp 1 "/path/to/input.txt"
To view Policy Iteration ONLY place a '2' before input
	example:  ./mdp 2 "/path/to/input.txt"
To view BOTH omit the number before input
	example:  ./mdp "/path/to/input.txt"

Assignment written in C++17
built on a little Endian macOS 10.15.4 using clang 11.0.0, cmake 3.15.3, and GNU Make 3.81


Main idea is to implement Value & Modified Policy iteration for a Markov Decision Process
Figures 17.4 & 17.7 in AIMA V3 respectively

These are examples of reinforcement learning algorithms
