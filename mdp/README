Let's try something new and attempt this assignment in C++17

Main idea is to implement Value & Modified Policy iteration for a Markov Decision Process
Figures 17.4 & 17.7 in AIMA V3 respectively

These are examples of reinforcement learning algorithms

P.S.  hope this goes well, else I'll have to try Python or Java
